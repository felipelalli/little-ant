# Implementation handoff

Current slice and gate: **S09 — Sources, Packs, imports, and repair; implementation in progress.**
S00-S08 are executable and mostly stable; S08 closure items remain open below.
Coverage labels stay conservative until every required recovery, uncertainty, and paired-surface row is fully evidenced.


Last committed baseline: **8377707** (`feat(recovery): complete atomic repair cutover`).
The current milestone establishes the host-owned export boundary. This file
stays editable between milestone commits.

## Implementation now available

- append-only replayable JSONL command groups, typed sparse results, persisted
  integrity-protected InteractionEnvelopes, factual loading progress, and the
  dumb Vty REPL foundation;
- Feed-first Raw triage, Natures/Templates, RawShelves, ListEntries, typed Raw
  links, duplicate suspicion, child Work, Domains, sibling-only importance
  insertion, and exact identity/handle separation;
- decaying human judgment, continuous adaptive ordering, nearby skip,
  provisional placement, provocative validation, contradiction recovery,
  independent Impact/Effort evidence, and optional phase;
- hierarchical replay-safe weighted forecast, Domain continuity/scope,
  N-step Dependency forwarding, Focus/WIP, skip diagnosis, Pomodoro, break,
  archive/restore, and checklist runs;
- exact dates/notices, repeatable jitter, recurrence, habit outcomes,
  scheduled commitments, operational-day boundaries, and truthful standing
  outcomes;
- ExternalEntity and ContactPoint state, Wait gates/reviews, Nature-aware
  Delegation coverage, immutable external effects, profiles/configuration,
  age-v1 encrypted vaults, and a profile-scoped AF_UNIX vault agent;
- dumb mini-simulations for external-condition Wait activation and manual
  Delegation from skip diagnosis through observed handoff;
- effect edit, defer, reject, approval, durable dispatch intent, and receipt
  transitions, with deferred effects excluded from the forecast.
- `lant doctor` runs before ordinary replay and auto-tick, reports the last
  valid cursor and event count, and identifies the first malformed event by
  canonical segment, physical JSONL line, and byte offset without mutating the
  dataset.
- a content-addressed repair plan can correct a provable segment-filename hash
  mismatch in a separate sibling dataset, replay the complete candidate, write
  a durable verification receipt, and reuse that candidate idempotently;
  unsupported corruption and stale plans fail before creating a candidate, and
  the live authority remains byte-for-byte unchanged.
- `lant repair` exposes separate preview, candidate-build, and cutover
  checkpoints with no default consent; cutover durably records its exact plan,
  uses an atomic same-filesystem directory exchange, resumes forward from
  pre- or post-exchange interruption, and retains the former authority as a
  read-only backup. Dry-run writes no repair artifact.
- `lant export` resolves a named, versioned exporter through an injected
  read-only port and supplies only a deterministic sparse structural
  projection. Export code receives no destination path or filesystem
  authority. The host either emits the artifact bytes to stdout or exclusively
  publishes one private new regular file through a same-directory temporary
  file and atomic no-clobber link; unsafe targets fail before exporter
  invocation, and dry-run writes nothing. The production registry remains
  empty until the Pack runtime is implemented: the standard serializers belong
  to the standard Pack rather than to the Haskell core.

## Last green gate

The most recent full commands were:

    nix develop -c make test
    nix develop -c make python-test spec-audit vocabulary

Every Haskell test suite, all 16 conformance tests, the canonical-ID audit, the
public-vocabulary guard, and explicit formatting checks pass at this
checkpoint. The targeted S09 source suite has 22 passing
source/translation/diagnostic/repair tests, including both cutover crash phases
and the public no-default consent flow. The new S09 export suite has 7 passing
tests for deterministic projections, stdout, dry-run, exclusive publication,
pre-invocation target rejection, exporter failure, and registry compatibility.
Lint, build, and CLI gates should still be rerun before S09 is declared
verified.

## Remaining S08 closure (carried forward from prior checkpoint)

Before marking the slice verified, close these deliberately visible gaps:

- request-not-yet-made must create explicit enabling Work plus its declared
  successor response Wait rather than display educational text only;
- prerequisite, absolute-time, and Place branches from blocked/waiting need
  complete previews instead of falling through to generic recovery copy;
- Wait follow-up, blocker replacement, custom date/time, repeated-follow-up
  strategy, and source-observed resolution need their complete state paths;
- Delegation no-response must honor `once | every | none`, produce a separate
  approval-bearing follow-up when allowed, and use strategy review at the soft
  cap; completion/refusal need full Nature-aware reconciliation;
- proposed-message editing after creation, adapter delivery, effect recovery,
  duplicate-risk retry, and compensation need executable paths;
- add CLI-level tests for profile/config/vault and the missing `vault update`
  surface; tighten secret-memory zeroization limitations where the Haskell
  `Text` representation permits;
- run `make ci`, not only `make test`, before declaring the slice closed.

## Next work

Finish S09 from [`slices/09-sources-packs-and-adapters.md`](slices/09-sources-packs-and-adapters.md) before continuing to S10.
Next, implement the minimal Pack archive, manifest, trust, and runtime registry;
then ship the standard Lua tree, table, RFC 4180 CSV, Org, self-contained HTML,
and TaskJuggler exporters through that boundary. Continue afterward with the
Raw-first import/adapters. The `Corrupt history/repair` row is implemented;
formal evidence registration and the complete S09 gate still precede
`verified`.
